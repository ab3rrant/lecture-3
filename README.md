/* concepts

- void, prevents returning a value

- local variables: variables declared within a method, can only be referenced from same method
- fields: variables declared within a class (outside of a method), declared private, referenced from anywhere in class
- global variables: variables accessible to all (classes, methods) 

Apparently fields are global variables in Java.

- lifetime of a variable
local variables exist while method executes
fields exist while class exists or object exists?

- methods
Methods have to be static if they are called from a method
that is also static.

- OO
organisation
reusability - declare instances and call their methods. vs creating method over and over.


- classes as data types
type - variable - value
class - object - classCopy

class name =newobject

- accessors & mutators
accessors: gives value from a field
mutators: Modifies value in a field

this.
